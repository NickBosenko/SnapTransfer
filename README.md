- 📱 Transfer files between phone and PC over local Wi-Fi  
- 📂 Support for all file types — you can now upload not only photos, but any files (documents, music, videos, and more) (**NEW**)  
- 🗂 File sorting by type — files are automatically organized into categories (Photos, Videos, Music, Documents, Other) both in the browser window and in the `uploads/` folder (**NEW**)  
- 🕒 File upload history — each file is saved with its upload date, and the browser window displays a history of uploaded files by day (**NEW**)

## 🖥 How to use

1. Download and extract the archive  
2. Run `SnapTransfer.exe`  
3. Your browser will open automatically with a local address (e.g. `http://192.168.0.36:8000`)  
4. On your phone, connect to the **same Wi-Fi** and open the same address in Chrome or Safari  
5. Upload or download photos easily between devices  

## 📁 Where are files stored?

You can reopen the program later and continue working with the same files.
